# HealthyLife: Personalized Weight Management.

## non-trivial caseX:
- The Food recipe with parameter(name,calories,price), eg: a certain amount of rice, meat and so on.

## trivial caseY:
- The list of Food added in the list and can add any number of food in the food list. Also it can sepearte a list to a low or high calories of every food in the food list.

A *bulleted* list:
- What will the application do? 

  I aim to develop an interactive Java-based application designed to gather user data, including weight, height,and so on with the objective of providing personalized food recipes, calorie calculations, and recommending suitable food list.
- Who will use it?

  The prospective user base for this project encompasses individuals seeking weight management solutions, whether it be weight loss or weight gain, as well as those with a keen interest in physical fitness and exercise.
- Why is this project of interest to you?

  My motivation for undertaking this project stems from a personal passion for physical fitness. Having experienced the challenge of gaining weight myself, I embarked on a fitness journey where I acquired knowledge about daily calorie requirements and exercise routines. This transformation allowed me to successfully achieve my weight goals. Moreover, I have observed numerous friends grappling with weight-related concerns, further fueling my interest in this project's subject matter.

## User stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to know my approximately basic metabolism based on my weights and heights.

- As a user, I want to be able to know the recommended list of food recipe.

- As a user, I want to be able to add one or any number of new food recipe(eg: noodle or  beef) to my daily recipe.

- As a user, I want to be able to view the whole food kinds and quantity as my daily use.

- As a user, I want to save the entire food list as my recommended food list

- As a user, I want to follow up where I'm left when using the food app.

- As a user, I want to load and print the food list.

## Phase4 Task3
if I have more time, I first will consider refactor by using the extract method, cause some the method like get low 
and get high food list appear similar and I would refractor them well and clearly. Also, if 
I have time, I would Split the FoodieFrame class into smaller classes or components, each responsible for a specific 
aspect of the application (e.g., UI handling, data management, event logging). This promotes better code organization
and makes the codebase more maintainable.
